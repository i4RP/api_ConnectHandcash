/**
 * purse-tests.js
 *
 * Tests for the Purse functionality of a wallet.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *      Copy this function into a browser or node script. Then:
 *
 *      const wallet = new MyWallet()
 *      const run = new Run({ wallet })
 *      purseTests(run, false)
 *
 * The supportsBackedJigs parameter depends on the wallet's implementation. If your wallet
 * will pay for non-dust outputs, pass true. If not, pass false. Either behavior is OK as
 * long as it is intentional.
